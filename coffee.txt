The student runs a cozy coffee shop and youâ€™re interested in how your drinks perform throughout the year. You track sales for hot drinks and cold drinks during Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.
Hereâ€™s the data for a full year:
	Winter	Spring	Summer	Fall	Total
Hot Drinks	100	60	40	100	300
Cold Drinks	20	40	120	40	220
Total	120	100	160	140	520
Simple probability:
Whatâ€™s the probability of picking a hot drink?
300 / 520 â‰ˆ 0.577
Joint probability:
Whatâ€™s the probability of picking a cold drink in summer?
120 / 520 â‰ˆ 0.231
Conditional probability:
Given itâ€™s summer, whatâ€™s the probability the drink is cold?
120 / 160 = 0.75
Decision-oriented:
If you want to boost cold drink sales in Spring, what marketing strategies might help?
Or, if hot drinks sell well in Winter and Fall, how could you capitalize on that?
